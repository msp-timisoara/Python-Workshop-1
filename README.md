# Python Workshop 1

## Introduction

General presentation of Python. Talk a bit about it’s features, it’s ease of use
and maintainability and it’s uses such as in machine learning and testing. Also
present it’s downsides as well to explain it’s limitations.

## What to cover in the presentation

- Python basics(variables, loops, functions)
- Cover some useful libraries
- Python classes

## Practical Examples

All of the above need to be accompanied with practical examples, to better
illustrate your point. Also it’s best if the examples add up to something bigger
and are not disconnected between them.

## Set up

Make sure every one is set up correct with the same version of Python(preferably
3.x), either with an IDE like Pycharm or can at least run python scripts man-
ually(if you want to do this, I recommend also presenting Powershell a bit).

## Workshop flow

After the quick presentation, I will try to cover the Python basics with the
help of turtle for better visualization. Taking advantage of this library will help
you when you try to explain things such as infinite loops, observing how things
change within a function and actually combining multiple elements to form more
complex structures. For example you start by drawing a simple square, than by
adding more elements like a triangle and multiple rectangles you get a house.


## End Goal

In the end the goal of this first workshop is to present Python and teach the
basics and also to ease people into OOP.
